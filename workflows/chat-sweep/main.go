// chat-sweep reviews the monitored WhatsApp chats for items already pending —
// an unanswered question, a promised action, an approaching deadline — and acts
// on the operator's behalf, or flags a decision for approval.
//
// It is the backlog counterpart to the webhook proxy, which only sees NEW
// messages. Ported from the compiled-in loop of the same name.
