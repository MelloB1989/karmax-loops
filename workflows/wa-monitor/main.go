//go:build wasip1

// Package wamonitor is the proactive WhatsApp proxy as an EVENT-DRIVEN loop:
// it fires on every incoming comms.message event (pushed by the wacli webhook —
// no polling, no scheduled LLM spend) and, for messages from MONITORED
// non-operator chats, has the Claude harness act on the operator's behalf:
// routine replies are sent in their voice, real decisions become approvals,
// operator-only items become phone reminders. Which chats are monitored is
// decided by the wacli webhook's scope (managed via the agent's
// whatsapp.monitor tool) — nothing is hardcoded here.
//
// NO MESSAGE THAT EXPECTS A RESPONSE GOES UNANSWERED: when the harness can't
// (or shouldn't) reply in the operator's voice — it flagged APPROVE/REMIND, or
// it failed outright — the loop itself sends a brief assistant note ("Kartik's
// away; I'm KARMAX, I've notified him") in DMs and group-mentions, rate-limited
// per chat so the same conversation never gets it twice in a row.
